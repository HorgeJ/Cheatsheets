# HTML Forms

### The FORM element 
The form element wraps a section of the document that contains form controls. The action attribute specifies the web address of a program that processes the information submitted via the form. The method attribute specifies the HTTP method that the browser should use to submit the form, such as POST or GET. Forms cannot be nested inside one another.

```html
<form>
  ... form controls ...
</form>
```

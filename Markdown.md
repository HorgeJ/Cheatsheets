# Mark Down Cheatsheet

## Headlines, paragraphs and basic formatting

### Headlines

#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

```
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```
### Paragraphs and Line Breaks
We create paragraphs by typing the way we would in any other program. 
just hit the return twice to start another paragraph.

Where you see empty space between blocks of text in your Markdown, 
you will see empty space seperating those blocks of text in your formatted HTML document.

```
Type to spaces at the end of a line and return once to start a new line  
without the space in between the lines of text
```

I love you without knowing you, or how, or  
from where  
I love you directly without problems or pride:
I love you like this because I dont know any  
other way to love

### Emphasis and Bolding

#### Italics
Created by surounding desired italics text in single astrisk

This *word* is in italics

```
This *word* is in italics
```

#### Bold
Created by surrounding desired bold text in double astrisks

This **word** is in bold

```
This **word** is in bold
```

#### Italics AND Bold
Done by combining both methods

This ***word*** is in italics and bold

```
This ***word*** is in italics and bold
```

### Blockquotes

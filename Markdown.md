# Mark Down Cheatsheet

## Headlines, paragraphs and basic formatting

### Headlines

#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

```
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```
### Paragraphs and Line Breaks
We create paragraphs by typing the way we would in any other program. 
just hit the return twice to start another paragraph.

Where you see empty space between blocks of text in your Markdown, 
you will see empty space seperating those blocks of text in your formatted HTML document.

I love you without knowing you, or how, or  
from where  
I love you directly without problems or pride:
I love you like this because I dont know any  
other way to love
